# Progress Log

Newest at the bottom. One entry per stage/session. Lean — link to specs, don't restate.

## 2026-06-27 — Project bootstrap
- Cloned `tanmatsu-template` into this repo; git is local-only (template kept as remote
  `upstream-template`, no push remote).
- Wrote `CLAUDE.md` (workflow, dedup/reuse policy, real-time audio rules) and initial
  specs `00`–`03`.
- Key findings: Tanmatsu audio is **output-only** (ES8156 stereo I2S DAC, no audio-in);
  USB-C = MIDI device, USB-A = MIDI host; ESP32-P4 has FPU + SIMD; 768 KB SRAM + 32 MB
  PSRAM. → synth is fully digital VA+hybrid.
- Chosen reuse anchor: **Mutable Instruments STM32 code (plaits/braids/stmlib), MIT.**
- Launched background agent to set up the ESP-IDF build env and report BSP audio/USB APIs.
- **Open:** five architecture questions in `02-synth-architecture.md` await Pascal.
- **Next:** ratify decisions → Stage 0 (hello-audio) once build env is green.
